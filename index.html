			<!-- medium description -->
			<p>My name is Ryan, and I'm a Junior Computer Science major at <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/" target="_blank">Rensselaer 
			Polytechnic Institute</a>.  In addition to my studies, I am a member of the varsity 
			<a href="https://rpiathletics.com/index.aspx?path=mcross" target="_blank">Cross Country</a> and 
			<a href="https://rpiathletics.com/index.aspx?path=mtrack" target="_blank">Track & Field</a> teams, and I helped 
			co-found the RPI Cubing Club.  I have experience with two office internships so far, and I am now 
			looking for a software engineering internship to further pursue my career goals. I am hardworking, 
			goal oriented, and extremely dedicated to bettering myself as an athlete, student, and a developer.</p>

			<p>My first internship came the summer after my freshman year with <a href="https://www.intelligentdata.com/" target="_blank">
			Intelligent Data Systems</a>, and then last year with <a href="https://www.yardi.com" target="_blank">Yardi Systems</a>. 
			At IDS I performed various task as I became accustomed to working in a fast paced software company.  My 
			work at Yardi last entailed providing support to clients answering any questions and resolving any issues 
			regarding the software.  I was also able to make use of my studies at Yardi by writing SQL packages to 
			make changes in the backend, and by writing Python scripts to help automate some tedious tasks.  Currently, I 
			am an undergraduate mentor for Introduction to Algorithms.</p>

			<p>My passion for running began back in my freshman year of high school. After joining the
			spring track team, I was instantly hooked into the sport and loved training and competing
			with my team.  Since then, I have always been very disciplined with my training, running up to
			90 miles per week for extended training periods.  Running for me is one of the cornerstones of 
			who I am, and has taught me how to lead an organized, consistent, and healthy lifestle.</p>

					<p>Syosset High School is where I began my endeavors in both coding and running.  With the wealth of 
					electives offered by the school, I chose to take intro to computer programming which lead me to take other courses offered in 
					the subject, leading up to AP CS. I also joined the robotics club where I 
					was the lead programmer for the <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc" target="_blank">FTC</a> 
					team. I joined the track team in the spring of my freshman year. I loved 
					the comptetitiveness of the sport and the culture of the team, and have considered myself a runner ever since.</p>

  				<!-- Mentor -->
  				<li>
  					<h3>Undergraduate Mentor - Introduction to Algorithms</h3>
  					<p><em>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute &#8226 Troy, NY &#8226 Fall 2018</em></p>
					
  					<p>Hosted lab hours for the class every Wednesday alongside other mentors and a graduate TA.  Assisted
  					students with any questions they had regarding the course material.  Helped walk students through solutions to 
  					various homeworks and assignments.</p>
  				</li>

  				<!-- Yardi -->
  				<li>
  					<h3>Associate Technical Account Manager, Intern</h3>
  					<p><em>Yardi &#8226 Melville, NY &#8226 July 2018 - August 2018</em></p>
						
  					<ul class="inner-list">
  						<li>Wrote SQL packages to amend client reported database issues.</li>
  						<li>Greatly improved internal efficiency and client response time by automating tasks with Python.</li>
  						<li>Worked alongside clients to identify, understand, and reproduce program/database issues 
  						and proposed solutions.</li>
  						<li>Documented client issues, resolution steps, processes, and training materials</li>
  					</ul>

  					<p>I really enjoyed my time at Yardi because I felt like a real member of the team, and not
  					just another intern.  I was tasked with the same work, and given the same responsibilites as
  					full time account managers, and enjoyed the challenges that came along with it. I was responsible for
  					working alongside clients to resolve various issues and answer any questions about the software. While this
  					wasn't explicitly a programming job, I was able to take initiative and write
  					a couple python scripts that saved many hours of tedious work, and boosted our
  					team's efficiency tremendously. My background knowledge of SQL also proved very useful for helping
  					clients resolve various data issues by writing SQL packages to make changes in the backend.  
  					With that being said, even though I was only an intern working for a short period of time, I 
  					really felt like a valuable member of team.</p>

  				<!--IDS-->
  				<li>
  					<h3>Student Intern</h3>
  					<p><em>Intelligent Data Systems &#8226 Williston Park, NY &#8226 May 2017 - August 2017</em></p>

					<ul class="inner-list">
  						<li>Analyzed data and created insightful visualizations using Microsoft Power BI.</li>
  						<li>Updated websites.</li>
  						<li>Wrote client-facing documentation of software.</li>
  						<li>Developed interoffice, personal, and phone skills.</li>
  					</ul>

						<p>The summer after my freshman year of college I interned at Intelligent Data Systems.
					At IDS, I had the opportunity to see the workings of a small software company. I was able to 
					observe how new technology was planned, developed, and finally delivered to clients.  At
					this job I was tasked with creating client-facing documentation of the software, updating
					our websites, answering phones, and what I found to be the most interesting -
					analyzing and creating visualizations of all the data in our database using Microsoft
					Power BI. I believe that my time at IDS was very valuable as it marked my first ever internship,
					as well as learning how a software company operates, and how a cloud based service can be 
					implemented and utilized.</p>
