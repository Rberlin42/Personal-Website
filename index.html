  							<p>Syosset High School laid the foundations for who I am today.  It is there
  							where I found my passions for both coding and running.  With the wealth of 
  							electives offered by the school, I chose to take intro to computer programming,
  							and I was instantly hooked.  This lead me to take the other courses offered in 
  							the subject, leading up to AP CS, and also joining the robotics club where I 
  							was the lead programmer for the FTC team. I also joined the track team in the 
  							spring of my freshman year. I loved the comptetitiveness of the sport and the 
  							culture of the team, and thus my passion for running begun.</p>

	  						<p>Hosted lab hours for the class every Wednesday alongside other mentors and a graduate TA.  Assisted

	  						<ul class="inner-list">
	  							<li>Test and reproduce program/database issues – understand, identify, reproduce client reported issues and propose resolution</li>
	  							<li>Create and maintain issues logs – enter and update client issues logs and cases through resolution</li>

	  							<li>Documentation – document client issues, resolution steps, processes, and training materials</li>
	  						</ul>

	  						<p>I really enjoyed my time at Yardi because I felt like a real member of the team, and not
	  						just another intern.  I was tasked with the same work, and given the same responsibilites as
	  						full time account managers, and enjoyed the challenges that came along with it.  While this
	  						wasn't explicitly a programming job, my CS background did come in handy, as I was able to write
	  						a couple python scripts for a coworker that saved many hours of tedious work, and boosted our
	  						team's efficiency tremendously. With that being said, even though I was only an intern working
	  						for a short period of time, I really felt like a valuable member of team.</p>

  						<h3>Student Intern</h3>
  						<p><em>Intelligent Data Systems &#8226 Williston Park, NY &#8226 May 2017 - August 2017</em></p>

  						<div class="indent">

	  							<li>Attended client visits with consultant</li>
	  							<li>Developed interoffice, personal, phone skills</li>
	  						</ul>

  							<p>My first internship came the summer after my freshman year with IDS.  This came with the
  							opportunity to see the workings of a small software company.  I was able to develop a feel
  							for how tech companies develop their software, deliver the product to clients, and how they
  							operate on a daily basis.  I also was able to develop my own office skills answering phones
  							and talking to clients, as well as learning a thing or two from the people around me.</p>
